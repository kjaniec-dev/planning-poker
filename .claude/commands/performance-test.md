Run performance tests and analysis:

1. Analyze bundle size for the Next.js frontend
2. Check for large components that may need optimization (e.g., results.tsx at 7000 LOC)
3. Profile React component rendering performance
4. Suggest load testing approach for WebSocket servers
5. Review connection handling capacity
6. Check for memory leaks or performance bottlenecks
7. Compare Node.js vs Golang server performance characteristics

Provide performance metrics and optimization recommendations.
