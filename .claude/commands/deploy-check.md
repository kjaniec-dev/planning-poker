Verify deployment readiness:

1. Validate Docker and docker-compose.yml configurations
2. Check Kubernetes Helm chart validity (if present in /chart)
3. Review environment variable requirements
4. Verify health check endpoints
5. Check security hardening (distroless images, security headers, etc.)
6. Review resource limits and scaling configuration
7. Validate production build process
8. Provide deployment checklist

Ensure the application is ready for production deployment.
