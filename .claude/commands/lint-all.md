Run all linting and code quality checks:

1. Run Biome linting for TypeScript/React code
2. Run TypeScript type checking across all workspaces
3. Check for formatting issues
4. Report any linting errors or warnings
5. Suggest running `npm run lint:fix` if auto-fixable issues are found

Provide a summary of any code quality issues that need to be addressed.
